# Supabase Integration

## Current Status

Currently, we've implemented mock data for the dashboard instead of connecting to Supabase. 
This is a temporary solution to allow development to continue while the Supabase connection issues are resolved.

## Issue Found

The original error was:
```
Dashboard data error: TypeError: supabase.from(...).select(...).group is not a function
    at GET (app\api\dashboard\route.ts:13:7)
```

This suggests there may be an issue with:
1. The Supabase JavaScript client version
2. The way group queries are formatted in the current version
3. Incorrect table structures in Supabase

## To Fix Supabase Connection

To fix the Supabase connection and use real data, you'll need to:

1. Verify that your Supabase instance is running and correctly configured
2. Ensure the required tables are created:
   - contacts
   - call_history
   - contact_lists

3. Check if your current Supabase client version supports the query syntax you're using. 
   You may need to update the query syntax to use SQL queries for grouping operations:

```javascript
// Instead of:
const { data: statusCounts, error: statusError } = await supabase
  .from('contacts')
  .select('status, count(*)')
  .group('status')

// Try using SQL:
const { data: statusCounts, error: statusError } = await supabase
  .rpc('get_status_counts') // Create a Postgres function for this

// Or:
const { data: statusCounts, error: statusError } = await supabase
  .from('contacts')
  .select('status')
  // Then process the results in JavaScript to count statuses
```

## Current Implementation

For now, we've implemented mock data that matches the expected format from the Supabase
queries. This allows development to continue without waiting for the database connection
to be fixed.

The mock data is defined in `app/api/dashboard/route.ts` and can be replaced with
real Supabase queries once the connection issues are resolved.
